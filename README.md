## Introduction

This guide describes how to integrate iProov biometric assurance technologies into your Android app.

iProov offers Genuine Presence Assurance™ technology and Liveness Assurance™ technology:

* [**Genuine Presence Assurance**](https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/technology/genuine-presence-assurance) verifies that an online remote user is the right person, a real person and that they are authenticating right now, for purposes of access control and security.
* [**Liveness Assurance**](https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/technology/liveness-assurance) verifies a remote online user is the right person and a real person for access control and security.

Find out more about how to use iProov in your user journeys in the [Implementation Guide](https://docs.iproov.com/docs/Content/ImplementationGuide/implementation-intro.htm).

iProov also supports [iOS](https://github.com/iproov/ios), [Xamarin](https://github.com/iproov/xamarin), [Flutter](https://github.com/iproov/flutter), [React Native](https://github.com/iproov/react-native), and [Web](https://github.com/iProov/web).

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- `minSdkVersion` API Level 21 (Android 5 Lollipop) and above
- Compilation target, build tools, and Android compatibility libraries must be API level 31 or above
- AndroidX

## Upgrading from Earlier Versions

See the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/iProov/android/wiki/Upgrade-Guide) for information about upgrading from earlier versions of the SDK.

## Obtain API Credentials

Obtain your API credentials by registering on [iPortal](https://portal.iproov.com/).

## Install the SDK

The Android SDK is provided in Android Library Project (AAR) format as a Maven dependency.

1. Open the `build.gradle` file corresponding to the new, or existing, Android Studio project that you want to integrate. Typically, this is the `build.gradle` file for the `app` module.

2. Add maven to the `repositories` section in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iProov/android/master/maven/' }
    }
    ```

3. Add the SDK version to the `dependencies` section in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation('com.iproov.sdk:iproov:9.0.2')
    }
    ```

4. Add support for Java 8 to your `build.gradle` file. Skip this step if Java 8 is enabled:

    ```groovy
    android {
        compileOptions {
            sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
            targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        }
    }
    ```

5. Build your project

## Get Started

To enrol (register) or verify (login) a user, follow the steps below.

### Get a Token

Obtain these tokens:

- A **verify** token for logging in an existing user
- An **enrol** token for registering a new user

See the [REST API documentation](https://secure.iproov.me/docs.html) for details about how to generate tokens.

> **TIP:** In a production app you typically obtain tokens via a server-to-server back-end call. For demos and testing, iProov provides Kotlin and Java sample code for obtaining tokens via [iProov API v2](https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/docs.html) with our open-source [Android API Client](https://github.com/iProov/android-api-client).

### Choose an Architecture

There are two ways to launch the SDK:

[IProovCallbackLauncher](#iproovcallbacklauncher) is most suitable for:

- Developers already familiar with previous versions of the iProov SDK who are looking for a simple upgrade path.
- Java-only apps.
- Kotlin apps which do not make use of [Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html).

[IProovFlowLauncher](#iproovflowlauncher) is most suitable for:

- Kotlin apps.
- Developers interested in the most modern API integration and who are familiar with [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) and [Flows](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html).

Both of these methods are demonstrated in the included [Example App](https://github.com/iProov/android/tree/master/example-app).

### IProovCallbackLauncher

#### 1. Create an instance of IProovCallbackLauncher

```kotlin
val iProovCallbackLauncher: IProovCallbackLauncher = IProovCallbackLauncher()
```

#### 2. Register a Listener

To monitor the progress of an iProov claim and receive the result, register an `IProovCallbackLauncher.Listener` class by assigning it to `iProovCallbackLauncher.listener = myListener`.

When the listener is no longer required, unregister it by unassigning this way: `iProovCallbackLauncher.listener = null`.

Complete the functions to handle events coming out of the claim.

```kotlin
class MainActivityCallback : AppCompatActivity() {
    private val iProovCallbackLauncher = IProovCallbackLauncher()
    private val listener = object : IProovCallbackLauncher.Listener {
        override fun onConnecting() {
            // Called when the SDK is connecting to the server. You could provide an indeterminate
            // progress indication to let the user know that the connection is being established.
        }

        override fun onConnected() {
            // The SDK has connected and the iProov user interface is now displayed. You
            // could hide any progress indicator at this point.
        }

        override fun onProcessing(progress: Double, message: String) {
            // The SDK updates your app with the streaming progress to the server and the user authentication.
            // Called multiple time as the progress updates. You could update a determinate progress indicator.
        }

        override fun onSuccess(result: IProov.SuccessResult) {
            // The user was successfully verified/enrolled.
            // You must always independently validate the token server-side (using the /validate API call) before performing any authenticated user actions.
        }

        override fun onFailure(result: IProov.FailureResult) {
            val reason: FailureReason = result.reason
            // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled as their identity could not be verified.
            // Or there was another issue with their verification/enrollment.
            // You might provide feedback to the user as to how to retry.
        }

        override fun onCanceled(canceler: IProov.Canceler) {
            // Either the user canceled iProov by pressing the Close button at the top right or
            // the Home button (canceler == USER)
            // Or the app canceled using Session.cancel() (canceler = APP).
            // You should use this to determine the next step in your flow.
        }

        override fun onError(e: IProovException) {
            // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled due to an error, for example, a lost internet connection.
            // You can obtain the reason from the reason property. It will be called once or not at all.
            // You should establish an actionable based on the kind of error preventing claim completion.
        }
    }

    // Overrides ----

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        iProovCallbackLauncher.listener = listener
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        iProovCallbackLauncher.listener = null
        super.onDestroy()
    }
}
```

> ##### Notes:
>
> * You should register the listener in `Activity.onCreate()`.
> * You can register only one listener.
> * Registering the same listener more than once has no effect.
> * You should unregister a listener in `onDestroy()` when you are finished with it, by setting to `null`.
> * You should maintain a reference to `iProovCallbackLauncher` whilst you have the listener registered.



#### 3. Launch a Claim

Call `iProovCallbackLauncher.launch()` to initiate a claim:

```kotlin
class MainActivityCallback : AppCompatActivity() {
    private val iProovCallbackLauncher: IProovCallbackLauncher = IProovCallbackLauncher()

    private fun launchIProov() {
        val options = IProov.Options()
        // Here you can customize any iProov options...
        val session = iProovCallback.launch(
            this, // Reference to current activity
            "wss://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/ws", // Streaming URL
            "{{ your token here }}", // iProov token
            options // Optional
        )
    }
}

```

### IProovFlowLauncher

#### 1. Create an Instance of `IProovFlowLauncher`

```kotlin
val iProovFlowLauncher = IProovFlowLauncher()
```

#### 2. Collect from the Main Output Flow

To monitor the progress of an iProov claim and receive the result, you collect from the `iProovFlowLauncher.sessionStates`. Each element of the Flow is an `IProovSessionState`, as shown below, consisting of a `Session` and an `IProovState`.

```kotlin
data class IProovSessionState(
    val session: Session,
    val state: IProovState
)
```

Collecting from this Flow provides each `IProovState` from the `Session` we just launched. This Flow is continuous and can be used for multiple `Session`s, although iProov only allows one `Session` to be active at a time.

Below is code with events completed (as used by the Example App). See the same events in [IProovCallbackLauncher](#iproovcallback) above for detailed explanations and usage suggestions.

```kotlin
class MainActivityFlow : AppCompatActivity() {
    private val iProovFlowLauncher: IProovFlowLauncher = IProovFlowLauncher()

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        lifecycleScope.launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
            repeatOnLifecycle(Lifecycle.State.CREATED) {
                iProovFlowLauncher.sessionsStates.collect { sessionState: IProov.IProovSessionState? ->
                    sessionState?.state?.let { state ->
                        withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
                            when (state) {
                                is IProov.IProovState.Connecting -> binding.progressBar.isIndeterminate =
                                    true
                                is IProov.IProovState.Connected -> binding.progressBar.isIndeterminate =
                                    false
                                is IProov.IProovState.Processing -> binding.progressBar.progress =
                                    state.progress.times(100).toInt()
                                is IProov.IProovState.Success -> onResult(getString(R.string.success), "")
                                is IProov.IProovState.Failure -> onResult(
                                    state.failureResult.reason.feedbackCode,
                                    getString(state.failureResult.reason.description)
                                )
                                is IProov.IProovState.Error -> onResult(
                                    getString(R.string.error),
                                    state.exception.localizedMessage
                                )
                                is IProov.IProovState.Canceled -> onResult(
                                    getString(R.string.canceled),
                                    null
                                )
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3. Launch a Claim

Call `iProovFlowLauncher.launch()` in a (Default dispatcher) coroutine to initiate a claim.

This starts background tasks to connect to the backend, then the iProov Activity starts and performs the scan, and finally it closes, returning to the original Activity while completing network activity and getting a result in the background.

```kotlin
class MainActivityFlow : AppCompatActivity() {
    private val iProovFlowLauncher: IProovFlowLauncher = IProovFlowLauncher()

    private fun launchIProov() {
        val options = IProov.Options()
        // Here you can customize any iProov options...
        lifecycleScope.launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
            session = iProovFlowLauncher.launch(
                applicationContext,
                "wss://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/ws", // Streaming URL
                "{{ your token here }}", // iProov token
                options
            )
        }
    }
}
```

### Session

A `Session` represents the lifecycle of a single claim. It has:

- `uuid` - this is unique to every session, even those without a token such a `InvalidSession`
- `token` - this is unique, and when using `IProovFlowLauncher` is can be used to distinguish events of one Session from another
- `currentState` - the current state of the claim, of the form `IProov.IProovState`, which `IProovFlowLauncher` receives
- `isActive` - whether the claim is still in progress (another cannot be started if this is true)
- `cancel()` - this allows the application to abort the claim

As an alternative to keeping the `Session` returned from `launch()`, the current or last `Session` can also be acquired (and canceled) these ways, respectively:

```kotlin
iProovCallbackLauncher.currentSession()?.cancel()
```
or

```kotlin
scope.launch {
    iProovFlowLauncher.currentSession()?.cancel()
}
```

> **Note**: You can [customize]( #customize-the-user-experience) the user experience by passing in an `IProov.Options` object.

> **Warning**:
>
> - The iProov process can be manipulated locally by a malicious user therefore never use iProov as a local authentication method. You cannot trust the returned success result to prove that the user was authenticated or enrolled successfully.
> - You can treat the success callback as a hint to your app to update the user interface but you must always independently validate the token server-side (using the `validate` API call) before performing any authenticated user actions.

> **Warning**:
>
> - [Google](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element#lmode) states that `singleInstance` and `singleTask` are not recommended for general use. iProov does not recommend the calling activity to have a `launchMode` of `singleInstance` - when tested, `back` does not always work correctly, particularly after the task switcher has momentarily put any `standard` Activity (like `IProov`) into the background.

## Customize the User Experience

You can customize the iProov user experience by passing in an instance of `IProov.Options` to the `launch()` function of instances of either `IProovCallbackLauncher` or `IProovFlowLauncher`.

> **Note**: The defaults defined support accessibility requirements and have been verified to [comply with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines](https://www.iproov.com/blog/biometric-authentication-liveness-accessibility-inclusivity-wcag-regulations). Changing any of these could invalidate compliance.

### General Options

The following values are found at the top level of `IProov.Options`:

| Option name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Default                                     |

| `titleTextColor`            | The color of the text in the title.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `Color.WHITE`                               |
| `headerBackgroundColor`     | The background color of the header bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `Transparent`                               |
| `filter`                    | The filter applied to the camera preview as either `LineDrawingFilter` or `NaturalFilter`. With `NaturalFilter` in LA, `surroundColor` will be opaque on the new rounded mask area.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `LineDrawingFilter()`                       |
| `surroundColor`             | The color of the area outside the guideline oval.

#### Certificate Pinning

By default, the iProov SDK pins to the iProov server certificates, which are used by `*.rp.secure.iproov.me`.

If you are using your own reverse-proxy, you will need to update the pinning configuration to pin to your own certificate(s) instead.

Certificates should be passed as a `String`, which is base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of a certificate's Subject Public Key Info. You can load a certificate as follows:

```kotlin
options.certificates = listOf(Certificate("O8qZKEXWWkMPISIpvB7DUow++JzIW2g+k9z3U/l5V94="))
```

To get Subject Public Key Info from a `.crt`, use the following command:

```sh
$ openssl x509  -in cert.crt -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
```

To get Subject Public Key Info from a `.der`, use the following command:

```sh
$ openssl x509 -inform der -in cert.der -pubkey -noout | openssl pkey -pubin -outform der | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | openssl enc -base64
```

When multiple certificates are passed, as long as the server matches **any** of the certificates, the connection will be allowed. Pinning is performed against the **whole** of the certificate.

You can also disable certificate pinning entirely, by passing an empty array:

```kotlin
options.certificates = listOf()
```

> **Warning**: Never disable certificate pinning in production apps!

## String Localization & Customization

The SDK ships with support for the following languages:

- English (United States) - `en-US`
- Dutch - `nl`
- French - `fr`
- German - `de`
- Italian - `it`
- Portuguese - `pt`
- Portuguese (Brazil) - `pt-BR`
- Spanish - `es`
- Spanish (Columbia) - `es-CO`
- Welsh - `cy-GB`

You can customize the strings in the app or localize them into a different language,

All strings are prefixed with `iproov__` and you can override them in `strings.xml` (download a copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/iProov/android/blob/master/resources/strings.xml)).

## Failures and Errors

A **failure** occurs when iProov successfully processes a claim but the user's identity cannot be verified.

- The capture was successfully received and processed by the server, which returns a result.
- The failure results in a `FailureResult`, which includes an enum called `reason` which has the following properties:
    - `feedbackCode` - A string representation of the feedback code.
    - `description` - You should present this to the user as it may provide an informative hint for the user to increase their chances of iProoving successfully next time.

An **error** occurs when a capture claim fails completely and iProov is unable to process it. Errors result in an `IProovException`.

1. Open the `example-app` project in Android Studio.

2. Open the `Constants.kt` file and insert your API Key and Secret at the relevant points.

3. Choose between `callback` (`IProovCallbackLauncher`) and `flows` (`IProovFlowLauncher`) variants by changing the build variant in Android Studio.

> **Warning**: The example app uses the [Android API Client](https://github.com/iProov/android-api-client) to directly fetch tokens on-device, which is insecure. Production implementations of iProov should always obtain tokens securely from a server-to-server call.

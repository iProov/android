## ü§≥ Introduction

The iProov Android SDK enables you to integrate iProov into your Android app. We also have an [iOS SDK](https://github.com/iproov/ios), [Xamarin bindings](https://github.com/iproov/xamarin) and [Web SDK](https://github.com/iProov/web).

### Requirements

- Android Studio
- API Level 19 (4.4 KitKat) and above
- Compilation target, build tools and Android compatibility libraries must be 29+
- AndroidX

Within this repository you can find the fictitious "Waterloo Bank" sample Android app, which illustrates an example iProov integration.

## üìñ Contents

The framework package is provided via this repository, which contains the following:

* **README.md** - This document
* **maven** - Maven repository for the SDK
* **waterloo-bank** - A sample project of iProov for the fictitious _Waterloo Bank_.
* **resources** - Directory containing additional development resources you may find helpful.


## ‚¨Ü Upgrading from earlier versions

If you're already using an older version of the iProov SDK, consult the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/iProov/android/wiki/Upgrade-Guide) for detailed information about how to upgrade your app.

## ‚úç Registration

You can obtain API credentials by registering on the [iProov Portal](https://portal.iproov.com/).

## üì≤ Installation

The Android SDK is provided in AAR format (Android Library Project) as a Maven dependency.

1. Open the build.gradle file corresponding to your new or existing Android Studio project with which you wish to integrate (commonly, this is the build.gradle file for the `app` module).

2. Add the repositories section to your build.gradle file:

	```groovy
	repositories {
	    maven { url 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iProov/android/beta/maven/' }
	}
	```

3. Add the iProov SDK to the dependencies section in your app's build.gradle file:

	```groovy
	dependencies {
		    implementation('com.iproov.sdk:iproov:5.3.0-beta2')
	}
	```

4. Add support for Java 8 to your app build.gradle file (you can skip this step if you already have Java 8 enabled):

	```groovy
	android {
	    compileOptions {
	        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
	        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
	    }
	}
	```

If you wish to make use of pose control functionality, you will also need to [add the Firebase module to your app](#-firebase-support).

You may now build your project!

## üöÄ Get started

Before being able to launch iProov, you need to get a token to iProov against. There are 2 different token types:

1. A **verify** token - for logging-in an existing user
2. An **enrol** token - for registering a new user

In a production app, you normally would want to obtain the token via a server-to-server back-end call. For the purposes of on-device demos/testing, we provide Kotlin/Java sample code for obtaining tokens via [iProov API v2](https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/docs.html) with our open-source [Android API Client](https://github.com/iProov/android-api-client).

Once you have obtained the token, you can simply call `IProov.launch()`:

##### Kotlin

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), IProov.Listener {

    // IProov.Listener interface ----
    
    override fun onConnecting() {
        // Called when the SDK is connecting to the server. You should provide an indeterminate
        // progress indication to let the user know that the connection is being established.
    }
    
    override fun onConnected() {
        // The SDK has connected, and the iProov user interface will now be displayed. You
        // should hide any progress indication at this point.
    }
    
    override fun onProcessing(progress: Double, message: String) {
        // The SDK will update your app with the progress of streaming to the server and authenticating
        // the user. This will be called multiple time as the progress updates.
    }

    override fun onSuccess(token: String) {
        // The user was successfully verified/enrolled and the token has been validated.
        // The token passed back will be the same as the one passed in to the original call.
    }

    override fun onFailure(reason: String?, feedback: String?) {
        // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled, as their identity could not be verified,
        // or there was another issue with their verification/enrollment. A reason (as a string)
        // is provided as to why the claim failed, along with a feedback code from the back-end.
    }

    override fun onCancelled() {
        // The user cancelled iProov, either by pressing the close button at the top right, or pressing
        // the home button.
    }

    override fun onError(e: IProovException) {
        // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled due to an error (e.g. lost internet connection)
        // You can obtain the reason from the reason property.
        // It will be called once, or never.
    }

    // Overrides ----

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        IProov.registerListener(this)
    }

    override fun onDestroy() {
        IProov.unregisterListener()        
        super.onDestroy()
    }

    private fun launchIProov() {
        val options = IProov.Options()
        // ...customise any iProov options...
        
        IProov.launch(
            this, // Reference to current activity
            "https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me", // Streaming URL (optional)
            "{{ your token here }}", // iProov token
            options // Optional
        )
    }
}

```

##### Java

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements IProov.Listener {

    // IProov.Listener interface ----
    
    @Override
  	 public void onConnecting() {
        // Called when the SDK is connecting to the server. You should provide an indeterminate
        // progress indication to let the user know that the connection is being established.
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onConnected() {
        // The SDK has connected, and the iProov user interface will now be displayed. You
        // should hide any progress indication at this point.
    }

    @Override
    public void onProcessing(double progress, String message) {
        // The SDK will update your app with the progress of streaming to the server and authenticating
        // the user. This will be called multiple time as the progress updates.
    }

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(String token) {
        // The user was successfully verified/enrolled and the token has been validated.
        // The token passed back will be the same as the one passed in to the original call.
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(@Nullable String reason, @Nullable String feedbackCode) {
        // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled, as their identity could not be verified,
        // or there was another issue with their verification/enrollment. A reason (as a string)
        // is provided as to why the claim failed, along with a feedback code from the back-end.
    }

    @Override
    public void onCancelled() {
        // The user cancelled iProov, either by pressing the close button at the top right, or pressing
        // the home button.
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(IProovException e) {
        // The user was not successfully verified/enrolled due to an error (e.g. lost internet connection)
        // You can obtain the reason by calling getReason().
        // It will be called once, or never.
    }

    // Overrides ----

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        IProov.registerListener(this);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        IProov.unregisterListener();
        super.onDestroy();
    }
    
    private void launchIProov() {
        IProov.Options options = new IProov.Options();
        // ...customise any iProov options...

        IProov.launch(
            this, // Reference to current activity
            "https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me", // Streaming URL (optional)
            "{{ your token here }}", // iProov token
            options // Optional
        );
    }
}
```

By default, iProov will stream to our EU back-end platform. If you wish to stream to a different back-end, you can pass a `streamingURL` as the first parameter to `IProov.launch()` with the base URL of the back-end to stream to.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY NOTICE:** You should never use iProov as a local authentication method. You cannot rely on the fact that the success result was returned to prove that the user was authenticated or enrolled successfully (it is possible the iProov process could be manipulated locally by a malicious user). You can treat the success callback as a hint to your app to update the UI, etc. but you must always independently validate the token server-side (using the validate API call) before performing any authenticated user actions.

## ‚öô Options

You can customize the iProov session by passing in an instance of `IProov.Option` to the `IProov.launch()` method. A list of available parameters for customization is below:

##### Kotlin

```kotlin
val options = IProov.Options()

/*
    options.ui
    Configure options relating to the user interface
*/

options.ui.autoStartDisabled = true // With autostart, instead of requiring a user tap, there is an auto-countdown a face is detected. Default false.
options.ui.title = "Authenticating to ACME Bank" // The message shown during canny preview. Default null.

// Adjust various colors for the camera preview:
options.ui.backgroundColor = Color.BLACK
options.ui.lineColor = Color.CYAN
options.ui.loadingTintColor = Color.RED // Please note this is option is deprecated, and only takes effect when used in conjunction with the useLegacyConnectingUI option.
options.ui.notReadyTintColor = Color.BLUE
options.ui.readyTintColor = Color.GREEN

options.ui.enableScreenshots = true // For added security, screenshotting is disabled during IProoving; re-enable this here. Default: false.
options.ui.fontAsset = "SomeFont.ttf" // Set the default font from assets directory.
options.ui.fontResource = R.font.some_font // Set the default font from font resources.
options.ui.logoImageResource = R.drawable.logo // Logo to be included in the title (takes precedence over logoImageDrawable). Defaults to iProov logo.
options.ui.logoImageDrawable = drawable // Logo to be included in the title. Defaults to iProov logo.
options.ui.scanLineDisabled = true // Disable the scan-line whilst scanning the face. Default: false.
options.ui.filter = filter // Adjust the filter used for the face preview this can be CLASSIC (as in pre-v5), SHADED or VIBRANT. Default: SHADED.
options.ui.orientation = orientation // Set the orientation of the iProov activity: enum Orientation (PORTRAIT, REVERSE_PORTRAIT, LANDSCAPE, REVERSE_LANDSCAPE). Note that this rotates the UI and does not rotate the camera; this is because it is intended to support USB cameras on a LANDSCAPE display, where the camera is oriented normally.
options.ui.useLegacyConnectingUI = false // When enabled, the iProov SDK will provide a UI for establishing the connection, rather than your app. Please note that this option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the SDK. You should now use the onConnecting() and onConnected() callback methods to provide your own UI for connection progress.

/*
    options.network
    Configure options relating to networking & security
*/

options.network.disableCertificatePinning = false // When true (not recommended), disables certificate pinning to the server. Default false
options.network.certificates = arrayOf(R.raw.iproov__certificate) // Optionally supply an list of resourceIDs of certificates files to be used for pinning. Useful when using your own baseURL or for overriding the built-in certificate pinning for some other reason. Certificates should be generated in DER-encoded X.509 certificate format, eg. with the command $ openssl x509 -in cert.crt -outform der -out cert.der
options.network.timeoutSecs = duration // The streaming timeout in seconds - setting to 0 disables timeout (default 10)
options.network.path = path // The path to use when streaming, defaults to "/socket.io/v2/". You should not need to change this unless directed to do so by iProov.

/*
    options.capture
    Configure options relating to the capture functionality
*/

options.capture.camera = Camera.EXTERNAL // FRONT or EXTERNAL (USB). Default is FRONT.
options.capture.faceDetector = IProov.FaceDetector.AUTO // Explicitly declare which face detector is used, can either be AUTO, FIREBASE or CLASSIC. The AUTO declaration will try to use the firebase face detector and fallback to classic if unavailable. Default: AUTO.
options.capture.firebaseAppInstanceName = "MyFirebaseApp" // The name of the FirebaseApp instance that is used to initialise the Firebase face detector, a null value means the default FirebaseApp instance is used. This is only needed when integrating the iproov-firebase module.

// You can specify max yaw/roll/pitch deviation of the user's face to ensure a given pose. Values are provided in normalised units.
// These options should not be set for general use. Please contact iProov for further information if you would like to use this feature.
options.capture.maxPitch = 0.25
options.capture.maxYaw = 0.25
options.capture.maxRoll = 0.25
```

## üåé String localization & customization

The SDK only ships with English language strings. You are free to localise/customise these strings in your app, if you choose to do so.

All iProov strings are prefixed with `iproov__` and can be overriden by your app's strings.xml file. A copy of the iProov strings.xml file can be found [here](https://github.com/iProov/android/blob/beta/resources/strings.xml).

Strings for failure reasons are handled in a special way, in the form `R.string.iproov__failure_<feedback code>` e.g. `iproov__failure_ambiguous_outcome` exist and will be used for `reason`, allowing it to provide localised translations for all current and future failure codes.

## üí• Handling failures & errors

### Failures

Failures occur when the user's identity could not be verified for some reason. A failure means that the capture was successfully received and processed by the server, which returned a result. This results in a call to the `onFailure()` listener method.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE:** It's important to understand the difference between _failures_ and _errors_. In a failure case, iProov was able to successfully process the claim, but was unable to verify the user's identity due to one of a number of reasons. In the error case, the claim failed entirely and iProov was unable to process the claim. 

| `feedbackCode` | `reason` |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ambiguous_outcome` | Sorry, ambiguous outcome |
| `network_problem` | Sorry, network problem |
| `motion_too_much_movement` | Please do not move while iProoving |
| `lighting_flash_reflection_too_low` | Ambient light too strong or screen brightness too low |
| `lighting_backlit` | Strong light source detected behind you |
| `lighting_too_dark` | Your environment appears too dark |
| `lighting_face_too_bright` | Too much light detected on your face |
| `motion_too_much_mouth_movement` | Please do not talk while iProoving |
| `user_timeout` | Sorry, your session has timed out |

The list of feedback codes and reasons is subject to change.

### Errors

In cases where the iProov process failed entirely (i.e. iProov was unable to verify or enrol the user due to a system failure of some kind), the `onError()` listener method will be called with a subclass of `IProovException`. These exceptions are as follows:-

- `CameraException` - An error occurred acquiring or using the camera. This could happen when a non-phone is used with/without an external/USB camera. See Options.capture.setCameraLensFacing().
- `CameraPermissionException` - The user disallowed access to the camera when prompted. You should prompt them to re-enable camera permissions via Settings.
- `CaptureAlreadyActiveException` - An existing iProov capture is already in progress. Wait until the current capture completes before starting a new one.
- `EncoderException` - An error occurred with the video encoding process. This should never occur.
- `FaceDetectorException` - An error occurred with the face detector. This is likely to be connected to a misconfiguration of Firebase.
- `LightingModelException` - An error occurred with the lighting model. This should never occur.
- `MultiWindowException` - The user attempted to iProov in split-screen/multi-screen mode,which is not supported.
- `ServerException` - The token was invalidated server-side, or some other unrecoverable server error occurred.
- `StreamingException` - An error occurred with the video streaming process. This generally indicates a device connectivity issue.
- `UnsupportedDeviceException` - The device is not supported, (e.g. does not have a front-facing camera).

## üë±‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Alternative face detectors

By default, the SDK leverages the [Android built-in face detector](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/FaceDetector). This is a simple face detector and is ubiquitous in Android phones, however it is not regularly updated. Therefore, we also support BlazeFace and Firebase face detectors.

###¬†BlazeFace

[BlazeFace](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05047.pdf) is a relatively lightweight and performant face detector. Whilst you should find that BlazeFace provides increased accuracy when compared with built-in face detector, it requires the inclusion of TensorFlow Lite with the SDK along with the necessary model, and therefore adds approximately 2.2MB to the downloaded app size. In our benchmarks, it also tends to run approximately 50% slower than the built-in "classic" face detector on very low-end devices.

####¬†Installation steps

Add the iProov BlazeFace module to your app's build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation('com.iproov.sdk:iproov-blazeface:5.3.0-beta2')
}
```

### Firebase

Google now direct their efforts into maintaining the [Firebase face detector, part of ML Kit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/detect-faces). The advantage of the Firebase face detector is that it provides more advanced features such as facial landmarks, which allows us to offer detection of the user's pose. Therefore, if you wish to make use of the pose control features, you will need to add the `iproov-firebase` module to your app.

####¬†Installation steps

1. Register your app on Firebase [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).

2. Setup Firebase within your app, either by adding `google-services.json` to your project, or by manually instantiating a `FirebaseApp` instance.

3. Add the iProov Firebase module to your app's build.gradle file:

	```groovy
	dependencies {
	    implementation('com.iproov.sdk:iproov-firebase:5.3.0-beta2')
	}
	```

4. If you integrated Firebase with `google-services.json`, you do not need to do anything further. If you manually instantiated a `FirebaseApp` instance, you need to set `options.capture.firebaseAppInstanceName` to the name of your instance.

Please note that adding Firebase support will increase your app size (as it will include the Firebase dependencies) and may also result in poorer performance on low-end devices, since Firebase is more computationally intensive.
